# Soup's YouTube Ad Skipper
Small JS script that adds buttons to the YouTube video player for skipping ads early.

## Setup
1. Copy the entire contents of [`bookmarklet.txt`](https://github.com/the-can-of-soup/soup_yt_ad_skipper/blob/main/bookmarklet.txt).
2. Create a bookmark in your browser.
3. Name the bookmark "Soup's YouTube Ad Skipper" (optional) and paste the code into the URL bar.
4. Save the bookmark.

## How to Use
1. Go to YouTube in your browser.
2. Click the bookmark you made.
3. There will now be a "Skip" and "Auto-Skip" button in your YouTube player. "Skip" will skip the current ad, and "Auto-Skip" will automatically skip all ads when enabled.

_Sometimes these buttons will appear on the left or the right depending on whether the video has chapters._

You will need to re-do these "How to Use" steps every time you close or refresh your YouTube tab.

## Note
If you know what you're doing, the program can alternatively work by simply pasting the contents of [`original.js`](https://github.com/the-can-of-soup/soup_yt_ad_skipper/blob/main/original.js) into the browser console.
